# Mobile Sales Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is a self-initiated effort to analyze and visualize mobile sales data using Power BI. It demonstrates my ability to clean data, create custom DAX measures, and build interactive dashboards to provide business insights.

## Objective
The goal is to track sales performance across multiple regions and product categories, enabling clear and actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX
- Microsoft Excel (for initial data preparation)

## Data Source
The dataset simulates mobile sales data, including fields like:
- Date
- Region
- Product Category
- Sales Amount
- Profit

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query.
- Custom DAX measures for revenue, profit margin, and growth rate calculations.
- Dynamic visualizations for sales trends, product performance, and regional comparison.
- Interactive slicers for region, category, and time period filtering.
- Automatic refresh simulation to mimic real-time data updates.

## Key Insights
- Top-performing product categories and regions.
- Monthly and quarterly sales trends.

## Business Value
This dashboard demonstrates how Power BI can replace manual Excel reporting, reducing data processing time and enabling faster, data-driven decisions.

## Summary
Developed an interactive Mobile Sales Performance Dashboard to analyze and visualize sales data across different product categories and regions.
Gathered raw sales data from mock datasets (representing retail mobile sales) and performed data cleaning & transformation using Power Query.
Built calculated columns and DAX measures to compute key performance metrics like Revenue, Profit Margin, Sales Growth %, Top Selling Brands, and Average Selling Price.
Designed dynamic slicers, filters for Region, Product Category, Sales Channel, and Time Period, enabling detailed data exploration.
Implemented trend analysis to identify peak sales periods and seasonal fluctuations.
Automated data refresh, simulating real-time updates to mimic production environments.
Applied conditional formatting and custom visualizations to make insights visually clear and actionable.
